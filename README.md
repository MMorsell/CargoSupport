# CargoSupport

CargoSupport is a real-time multi user workspace specifically designed for storage and warehouse operations. It is an C# core application that uses SingalR in order to push changes to clients in close to real time. Combined with MongoDB as database, this is a really good combination.

The idea is to later on reflect from the information from stations and deliveries, thats why this webserver also have many different analyze-pages, of course these are protected by authorization and authentication so no unauthorized access can occur.
